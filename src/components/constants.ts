In AD 563, Columba and his followers arrived here from Ireland to spread the gospel in Scotland and the north of England. The restored medieval abbey continues to hold daily services today and St Oran's Chapel and Reilig Odhram is reputed to be the burial place of 48 kings of Scotland, including Macbeth.",

But the Bealach is an unforgettable drive up and along one of the most dramatic roads on mainland UK, rivalling many a Swiss mountain pass and with terrific views across much of Wester Ross.",
